Hi all. This is just some code from me following the [How I Start Elixir](http://howistart.org/posts/elixir/1) exercise by Jos√© Valim. Basically, I created an application that allows for linked stores between separate Elixir processes (not system processes, just lightweight Erlang processes that are spawned by a Supervisor).

This is just for learning purposes, and follow the code exactly from above.
